<B>The abridged version of my evacuation from Katrina</B>

<P>On Saturday, August 27, my brother called me at about 9 a.m. to let me know that the storm was coming and that he and his family were on their way to Memphis.  I didn't know anything about a hurricane, I was hanging out downtown the night before, and my brother had just woken me up.  He strongly urged me to evacuate.  I had a show to play that night, and I had JUST HEARD about this thing right then and there.  Plus, I spent 14 hours in my car last year evacuating to Houston for a storm that didn't even touch N.O.  I really did not feel like doing this.  I decided to get things together in case I did evacuate, and monitor the storm on the radio throughout the day.

<P>I was on the phone a lot, trying to determine if the show was still on.  Later on in the day, it turned out that the rest of the bands cancelled because of the storm, so there was no show.  A bunch of friends decided to get together at Joe’s house for a “hurricane party.”  Reports were consistent that the storm was heading straight for N.O. and was strengthening.  I packed my things and made my evacuation plans.  We hung out and drank at Joe’s that night, and watched the storm on television.  No change in the storm’s path.  We discussed what we each were going to do, shook hands, and wished each other luck.

<P>The next morning, Sunday, August 28, I drove to sister’s place, picked her up, chose a direction, and headed east.  We eventually decided to meet up with our family in Memphis.  We got hotel rooms and tried to relax.  The next day, Monday, August 28, Katrina hit.

<P>We spent a week in Memphis watching New Orleans and St. Bernard Parish getting fucked.  We realized we weren’t going home any time soon, that it would be a matter of months.  We needed to find a friendly place with folks that could house us all for at least a month.  It seemed to be between New York and Oregon.  I liked the idea of going to the west coast, because I hadn’t been further west than Colorado.  We drove for 5 days and made it to Portland.  We stayed with my sister-in-law’s sister and her family, and her next-door neighbor housed some of us.

<P>I knew that my house was trashed.  I needed a good distraction from reality, and I had been attending class for one week at the UNO counseling grad program, so I decided to look for programs in Portland.  I had already lost my home, and I wasn’t willing to lose a semester.  Lewis and Clark was the most inviting and had me come by and sit in on a class.  The people there were very friendly and accommodating, and it was a relaxed atmosphere, so I chose to jump into their counseling psych. program.

<P>I got an apartment, a job, and a school in Portland, and friends in New Orleans.  I still have no plan.  I don’t know what’s to become of N.O. and I don’t feel I can make a rational decision about where I’m going to spend the rest of my life.  I went back for New Year’s and spent a week checking out my house and spending time with friends, and saying goodbye properly.  I’ll have pictures up soon, I’ve got plenty to post.  I’ll also write more when I have the energy.  This story isn’t over yet.<BR><BR>

i've heard, as we all may have, that the ultimate example of the conjoinment of human physiology and technology is the concept of having a human being replicated as pure information.  in other words, taking the human body, mind, soul, spirit, mentality, philosophy, personality, etc. and translating it all into a definative, albeit extremely complex, system of infallable data.  this is entirely possible.  although humankind may not be able to efficiently and conveniently quantitate such dynamic ideas as human personality, it would be possible - should it be understood well enough to be predictable - to transcribe the entirety of human nature into a vast set of reliable theorems.  at this time, this idea is fantasy.  we are trying to develop artificial intelligence, learning machines that are capable of adaptation, self-improvement, and evolution into a higher state of consciousness.  even if this was achieved, as you may imagine, it would be even more extraordinary to develop a system that can account for the variations of human development that effect our personalities, i.e., the multitude of factors that make us all unique.  to be able to master such a complex system would require an absolute understanding of human nature; not an easy goal to achieve.<BR><BR>

suppose this was possible.  suppose that every aspect of one person's lifespan could be transcribed into a unified data set.  that would mean that one person's lifetime could be reiterated as a simulation... and could be reenacted as a computer program.  mylife.exe.  in reality, anything that we can understand could be programmed and duplicated as a vast series of 1's and 0's.  this idea exists, or it does not.  i am, or i am not.  it depends on the program, doesn't it?  i could be a doctor, a firefighter, or a convict.  it depends on the summary of FACTS.  i am drunk.

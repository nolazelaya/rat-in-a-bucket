	<I>frequently asked questions</I><br>

	<b>1. where did you get the name 'rat in a bucket'?</b><br>
<br>

	
	&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp okay, i guess it's about time we level with you, since we've been asked this <B>numerous</b> times.  the name comes from an ancient aztec proverb, based around a tradition that began, and ended, quite suddenly in the midst of aztec history.  a custom emerged to celebrate the new year by gathering up the rats that ran rampant throughout the villages.  these rats were to be sacrificed 
	to ixythzytitchatytlizztlitcan, the aztec rat-spirit.  according to the ancient aztecs,
	the rat represented the spirit of survival, physical endurance, and the ability to multiply rapidly by means of inbreeding, a quality that the aztecs found particularly appealing.
	what the villagers actually did with the rats is, frankly, appalling.  they would throw the rats they collected, usually numbering in excess of 3,500 rats, into what was essentially a large stone mortar and pistle.
	the rats were then brutally ground into a thick bloody paste, still crunchy from the small bone fragments (sort of like extra crunchy peanut butter, but with rat bones instead of nut fragments, and chunky rat-gravy instead of peanut butter).
	next, the bravest warriors of the village would engage in a gory competition, as each man would take turns dipping a silver cup into the festering goo and swallow its contents.  those that would vomit during or after the ritual were stripped, skinned, 
	and cast out into the jungle as a coward and an obvious embarrassment to the village.  the luckless outcast would die quickly, either being eaten by wild beasts, or succumbing to massive infections, as was apparently the will of the aztec gods.  
	those passing this part of the trial would then begin the second rite, consisting of a nude spear battle.  not surprisingly, many warriors died of multiple stab wounds during this phase.  for the third and final segment of the ritual, the barely surviving 
	warrior would sit meditating at the center of the village, while the rest of the villagers watched and waited patiently; the aztecs believed that if the warrior survived the night without disturbances, the entire village was blessed, and would be assured a 
	bountiful and prosperous year.  however, if the warrior would keel over and die, the village was doomed.  with that being the worst possible scenario, the villagers would promptly unsheath their knifes and commit ritualistic suicide, which they considered 
	acceptable reprise from a year of famine, plagues, relentless struggle, invasions, and starvation.  perhaps the most striking aspect of this gruesome ritual is the fact that, considering the ancient aztecs' ignorance to modern medicine and the presence 
	of microbial predators, the act of consuming a cup of liquified raw rat carcasses was 100% fatal.<BR><BR>

	&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp the villages began to die off one by one.<BR><BR>

	&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp historians are now holding true that this ritual was the sole cause of the sudden extinction if this once magnificant, prosperous, and yet very, very, very 
	stupid civilization.<br>
	&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp the fact that the proverb was found in written form suggests that some sort of wisdom did in fact rise up from the folly of the early aztec civilization.  studies so far have offered two explanations which have gained acceptance by contemporary historians.  
	the first possibility, and also the least likely, is that there were survivors from the pre-european era of the central americas who recognized the flaws behind this short-lived new year ritual.  written reports from early spanish explorers recall an account from one of the native land navigators.  
	according to the spanish records this aged man, who identified himself only as queequeg, was a leper who had miraculously survived his affliction.  it has been suggested that the old man, who according to spanish documents was "missing the skin in large patches, and...very  
	haggard and frightful in appearance."  was actually a banished warrior who had survived the skinning.  obviously, it would take a great deal of physical strength and fortitude to endure such a feat, although it is possible that this "leper" may have had knowledge 
	of botanical and herbal remedies that could have offered protection from infection, and possible healing properties.  all of this is of course speculation; although this tracker reportedly had extensive knowledge regarding the geography of the former aztec land, as well the 
	location of several destroyed villages and temples, he was also "quite a dirty old man."<br>
  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp the other, more widely accepted explanation, is that the proverb actually originated from another civilization, one that lived simultaneously with yet separately from the aztecs.  the texcoco and tacuba, two neighboring tribes and once allies of the aztec civilization, 
  have been suggested to be the inheritors of the aztec legacy.  the fact that the proverb was printed originally in the aztec pictographic language, would indicate an homage to, if not a continuation of, the nahuatl tradition of nobility.
	
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp the proverb that derived from this uncanny ritual reads: "macamo ticocoazque in yuh quimichtin itech comitl; intia titlacua tlatlacatecoloh auh timiquizque."  translated loosely into english, it means: "it is better to suffer as a <b>rat</b> drowning <b>in a bucket </b>
of its own urine, than to eat a cup of smashed-up rats and die like an idiot."  our singer shaun happened upon this phrase in 1996, quite by accident,  while exploring the white mountains of peru, searching for a legendary and elusive creature: the giant peruvian aquatic bouncing mountain llama. having no sense of direction, he wound up in mexico.<br>

<b>2. you guys have never printed lyrics.  what sort of things do you sing about?</b><br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp our lyrics typically revolve around morbid subject matter,
 such as: the worship of demons, the devil, or various pagan deities (particularly those of 
the babylonian/sumerian pantheon); the human consumption of other humans (particularly dead 
females); various serial killers; having intercourse with dead bodies; eating babies; blood, intestines, and other internal organs and 
the consumption thereof; how much we hate the catholic church, and how we blame god for everything bad that happens in our lives.  all lyrics have been written after midnight during 
any of the four witch's sabbathsesises, amidst clove cigarette smoke, in a dark corner of a coffee shop in the french quarter.  
the following is an example of a lyrical set typical of our writing:

<P STYLE="margin-left: 200"><B>necro-crypts of shumziggurathominon</B><br>
<br>
it is night and i am insane<br>
evil thoughts consume my brain<br>
waiting for my time to strike<br>
i want to f**k you with a knife<br>
<br>
absu!  absu!  we call upon thy name<br>
take this offering, burning flesh,<br>
satan<br>
<br>

i will tie you up and take a knife<br>
and pierce you in a location<br>
that covers a major organ or blood vessel<br>
in such a manner that the organ or blood vessel is ruptured,<br>
so as to cause severe, terminal tissue damage;<br>
i will continue this process repeatedly<br>
until your organ system fails, resulting in death.</P>

<b>3. is this a joke?</b><br><br>

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp no.  next question. <br>
<br>
<b>4. no, seriously...is it a joke?</b><br><br>

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp yes.<br>

So we'll be ready to start doing shows pretty darn soon. &nbsp; We'll try to keep shows posted as soon as they are scheduled.<BR><BR>

Those of you who write us at <A href="mailto:band@ratinabucket.com">band@ratinabucket.com</A> will notice that you will immediately receive an automated response letter. &nbsp; We've received numerous requests from all sorts of bands asking us to help them book a show in New Orleans. &nbsp; Some of these e-mails seem like they're from bands who really need help. &nbsp; Others seem like they are from shitty indie rock bands from the midwest who sent out spam to everyone with an e-mail address. &nbsp; We would like to be able to help out any band that needs it; the problem is that we usually don't book shows ourselves, and when somebody asks us for help, we usually send off the same information each time. &nbsp; To eliminate hassle on our part (and to weed out the dickhead spammers who don't even know what we sound like) we have set up an auto-response which contains links to New Orleans promoters, courtesy of <A HREF="http://noladiy.org">noladiy.org</A>. &nbsp; Please don't let this throw you off. &nbsp; <U>We read all e-mail we receive</U>, and answer any questions folks have. &nbsp; We just figured that if a band needs a kick in the right direction in trying to book a show, they should use the same resources we do. &nbsp; If you have a question/comment besides help with booking, we will respond; and in so doing, will provide an alternate e-mail address so you don't continue to receive the same auto-response each time you reply. &nbsp; Hopefully, this will solve problems on everybody's part, and we can continue to live in peace and harmony, forever and ever.<BR><BR>

Until the <A HREF="http://www.shaunofthedead.co.uk/">zombies</A> come to eat our brains.
